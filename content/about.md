# About

Greetings, this is just an average blogsite for a security professional that is knowingly ignorant of many things and unknowingly ignorant of even more. 

The purpose of this blog is: 
1) To contain my excited ramblings about tech 
2) To document what I'm working on at any point 
3) To occasionally share useful pointers/tips where I've managed to unblock myself
4) To start putting some of my hobby work in the public domain

The source code for all posts is available [here](https://github.com/securityphilistine/blog). If you find any information here incorrect or missing, I would be extremely happy for you to raise Issues/PRs there with your corrections. 

This blog is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the excellent [Mini Hugo theme](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini). 

# My Interests

I enjoy many different aspects of security, but the majority of my limited knowledge comes from my career in defensive security. In particular I adore detection engineering, SIEM and logging technologies. I also enjoy building tooling and automation for incident response. 

Outside of security I also adore homelabbing, linux, networking and datacenter technology, with lessening experience in each respectively.
